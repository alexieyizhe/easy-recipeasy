# Easy Recipeasy

Easy Recipeasy is a recipe web app that makes it easy for you to find new recipes and cook them! It has features like custom login and profiles to save recipes you like, and Flipp integration so that you can find the best deals on ingredients.

This app was built with Rails with a MySQL database and HTML/CSS/JS front end. All code except most of the styling CSS was written by me (I'm pretty horrendous at CSS styling). It's currently hosted on Heroku [here](https://easy-recipeasy.herokuapp.com/) (be patient, Heroku needs time to spin up those dynos and load the app since I'm a poor college free user :/)!
