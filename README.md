# Easy Recipeasy

Easy Recipeasy is a recipe web app that makes it easy for you to find new recipes and cook them! It has features like custom login and profiles to save recipes you like, and Flipp integration so that you can find the best deals on ingredients.

This app was built with Rails with a MySQL database and HTML/CSS/JS front end. All code except the design of the website was written by me (I'm pretty horrendous at CSS styling so that's why I chose to use a template for that part).
