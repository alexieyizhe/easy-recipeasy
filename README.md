# Easy Recipeasy

Easy Recipeasy is a recipe web app that makes it easy for you to find new recipes and cook them! It has features like custom login and profiles to save recipes you like, and Flipp integration so that you can find the best deals on ingredients.

This app was built with Rails with a MySQL database holding all the users and recipes, complemented by a front end of HTML/CSS/JS. All code except most of the styling CSS was written by me (I'm pretty horrendous at CSS styling). 

It's currently hosted [at this link](http://easyrecipeasy.ml/) if you want to check it out!
